# Multiclass Text Classification Project

**Case Study - Midterm Examination**
As a Data Scientist at a research institution, the task is to build a multiclass text classification model. However, in this case study, there is no pre-existing dataset available. This project demonstrates the steps to construct such a model using various text preprocessing techniques, model selection, and evaluation approaches.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on solving a multiclass text classification problem in which the goal is to categorize text into different predefined classes. Given that there is no pre-existing dataset, the project explores how to simulate or gather text data, preprocess it, build and train a classification model, and evaluate its performance. Techniques like feature extraction, vectorization, and the application of supervised learning algorithms are demonstrated.

## Steps Involved
1. **Data Generation via Web Scraping**
In this project, web scraping is used to collect text data from news websites. The content of various articles is scraped and labeled based on predefined categories for classification purposes. Python libraries like BeautifulSoup and requests are used for this task.
