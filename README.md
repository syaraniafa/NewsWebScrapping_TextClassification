# Multiclass Text Classification Project (Text Mining)

## Case Study - Midterm Examination ##
As a Data Scientist at a research institution, the task is to build a multiclass text classification model. However, in this case study, there is no pre-existing dataset available. This project demonstrates the steps to construct such a model using various text preprocessing techniques, model selection, and evaluation approaches.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on solving a multiclass text classification problem in which the goal is to categorize text into different predefined classes. Given that there is no pre-existing dataset, the project explores how to simulate or gather text data, preprocess it, build and train a classification model, and evaluate its performance. Techniques like feature extraction, vectorization, and the application of supervised learning algorithms are demonstrated.

## Steps Involved
1. **Data Generation via Web Scraping**
In this project, web scraping is used to collect text data from news websites. The content of various articles is scraped and labeled based on predefined categories for classification purposes. Python libraries like BeautifulSoup and requests are used for this task.
2. **Text Preprocessing**
After scraping the news articles, the following preprocessing steps are applied to clean and prepare the text data:
    - Tokenization
    - Stopword removal
    - Text normalization (lowercasing, punctuation removal, etc.)
    - Vectorization using techniques like TF-IDF
3. **Model Selection**
Various classification algorithms are considered, such as:
    - Naive Bayes
    - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    - Random Forest These models are trained on the processed text data to predict the correct news category.
4. **Model Training**
The data is divided into training and testing sets. The model is then trained using the training data, applying supervised learning techniques.
5. **Model Evaluation**
After training, the model is evaluated using standard metrics, such as:
    - Accuracy
    - Precision, Recall, and F1-Score for each category
    - Confusion Matrix for detailed class-wise performance
6. **Optimization and Tuning**
To enhance performance, hyperparameter tuning methods, such as grid search, are implemented for the chosen model.

## Results
The results section showcases the model's performance based on the evaluation metrics discussed earlier. The best-performing model will be highlighted, and an analysis of its predictions on the test data will be presented.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to handle a multiclass text classification task in a research setting with no initial dataset. It walks through the process of generating data, preprocessing, model building, and evaluating the classification results.
